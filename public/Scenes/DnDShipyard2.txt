\f0\fs24 \cf0 You crawl into a barrel and wait until nightfall.  Just before midnight, a small hooded figure walks by.  The figure begins muttering under their breath as a crate of cargo lifts off the ground.  They levitate it behind them, walking away from the shipyard.  Just as they pass by you, you jump out at them.  They lose concentration, and the crate crashes to the ground.  The figure removes his hood to reveal\'85the same portly halfling from the tavern - what the heck?\
