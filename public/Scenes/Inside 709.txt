You're in the study room in 709 watching youtube videos, as usual, when suddenly your stomach rumbles loudly. Your building-mates stare daggers at you for being so intentionally loud. You are very hungry. It's 12:45, all of the dining halls are closed! You must get to Price Center before Tapioca Express closes in 15 minutes (well, you could always eat at Burger King but you wouldn't dare lower your fine palate to such common cuisine).
