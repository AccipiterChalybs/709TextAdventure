Before you can cast a spell, Pabu jumps off your shoulder and begins juggling pebbles on the ground.  Apparently he’s been practicing, and is soon juggling 8 pebbles at once.  For added effect, you cast Level 1 Minor Fireworks behind him.  The gnome is so impressed, she gives you her nicest bag for free! But your celebration is short lived, as you sense an ominous force coming from the Durger King’s castle.|To the castle!~DnDCastleShon
