You grab the Canoe, leave some money on the counter, and attempt to paddle up the paved path. It is not just extremely slow, but also extremely hard - land canoeing isn't for everyone. The racoon from earlier is no longer there, and so you continue on your path, paddling up the stairs next to some dumpsters. Scratching noises are all the warning you have before more raccons burst out from inside the dumpsters.|Fight them with your canoe and paddle~RacoonBattle|Run away~VA1|Wait and see what they do~RacoonDefeat
