You wake up laying down in an empty plain. The fresh dewdrops on the blades of grass make them shimmer in the sunrise. Yet despite the calming scene you feel uneasy, perhaps even worried. Then it dawns on you: What is your name? Where is your home? Who are you? You sit up, overcome with panic, that you are unable to answer these questions, that you have somehow lost your memory. But you remember one thing, that the world you come from has no grass plains or sunrises. You stand up and look around. |
