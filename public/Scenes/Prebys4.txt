You have nothing to fight with but luckily for you the KND arrives to do the fighting. Unfortunately for you however, you recently turned 18, and the KND hates adults. The kids finish off the evil oldies with ease and then turn to you. Numbah one approaches you and starts talking. "That was very noble of an adult such as yourself to fight for us. But might I ask, why were you in a concert for senior citizens in the first place?"|"I am on a quest for TapEx"~Prebys5|"Because I wanted to"~Prebys5|"None of your buisness"~PrebysEnd2|"Let me join you"~Prebys6|
