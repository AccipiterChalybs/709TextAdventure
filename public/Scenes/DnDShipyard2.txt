You crawl into a barrel and wait until nightfall.  Just before midnight, a small hooded figure walks by.  The figure begins muttering under their breath as a crate of cargo lifts off the ground.  They levitate it behind them, walking away from the shipyard.  Just as they pass by you, you jump out at them.  They lose concentration, and the crate crashes to the ground.  The figure removes his hood to reveal…the same portly halfling from the tavern - what the heck?
“How did you know it was me?  No matter, you will not leave here alive! Muahahaha”|Kill him~DnDShipyard3|No seriously, kill him.  He’s level 2 and you’re at least level 8~DnDShipyard3|Fine, try to capture the halfling so he can go to jail~DnDHalflingDeath
