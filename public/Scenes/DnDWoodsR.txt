You reach a clearing in the woods. In the center stands an unnaturally white horse with Pabu on its head. You have heard legends of the legendary Lord of Horses, but never did you imagine you would actually encounter him, the mighty Shadowfacts. He knows virtually everything there is to know about shadows. Sensing your urgency to save the king, Shadowfacts kneels before you, offering itself as a steed.  You, Pabu, and Shadowfacts head off into the sunset to your next destination, the Port of Triton|Fly, you fools!~DnDPort
