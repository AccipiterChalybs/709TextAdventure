You heard that Alex’s D&D sessions are super killer, so you wait a few minutes for it to start.

“Welcome adventurers. When we last left you, you had just received a letter from the Durger King of the Prace Canter Kingdom. He has instructed you to come to his aid immediately, for he is under attack by a horde of mildly irritated goblins.  The castle will fall in 15 days, which is coincidentally equivalent to 15 minutes IRL. Before we begin, which adventurer will you choose?”|Sir Ambrosius Goldenloin, the righteously good-looking half-angel paladin~DnDAmbrosius1|Shonmander, the laserbeam-weilding human wizard, and Pabu, his friendly fire ferret~DnDShonmander1|Reau, the bag-hiding, sneak-attacking halfling rogue~DnDReau1|Vinculum, the elf ranger who once headshotted a lich mid-monologue~DnDVinculum1
