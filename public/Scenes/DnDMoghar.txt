On your way to the tavern, you run into your good friend Moghar, the half-orc warrior.  From his guttural screams you take it he just got back from a mighty battle.  Communicating purely through jumping and screaming, he offers to take you to the Port of Triton, where you can find a ship to sail you to the Prace Canter Kingdom.  Indeed, a Moghar leap would be much faster than riding a horse. You hop on his back.|Roll to jump~DnDPortReau
