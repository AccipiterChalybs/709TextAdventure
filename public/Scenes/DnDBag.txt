While walking down the street, you hear a voice shout “Bags of Holding! Get your Bags of Holding, right here!  You there!  Have you ever needed to hold things?  Well do I have the bag for you!”  Turning, you see nothing. “Down here!”  Looking down, you see a small gnome next to bags several times larger than her.
