In the alley, you find a mysterious man in a large cloak.  He pulls back one side of it to reveal an array of glass bottles, filled with liquids of different colors and viscosities.  Some of them even appear to glow.
“Hey, want some of the good stuff? First one’s free.”
You feel like this will do, so you take him up on his offer and bring the glowing vial back to the gnome.|Get that bag!~DnDBag2
