You continue to wait at the bus stop. Time goes by. You check your watch. Minutes go by. Suddenly, when all hope seemed lost, from the distance a Campus Loop bus emerges. You are delighted - it should go straight to Price Center! You relax as it begins to drive away. Suddenly, a loud crash reverberates throughout the bus. Looking outside the window, you see a truck has driven alongside the bus, harpooned the bus with a grappling hook, and is now spewing out pirates attempting to board the bus.
