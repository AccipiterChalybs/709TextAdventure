The DM is too tired to think of another event, so you sail across the entire Pepper Sea with literally zero inconveniences or interruptions of any kind.  You arrive on the shores of the Prace Canter Kingdom.  In the distance, you see a large column of smoke.  That is obviously the Durger King’s castle, but can you make it in time?  How many days do you have left before the castle is razed?|4 days to the Port of Triton, and 6 days sailing equals 5 days left! You have enough time to go shopping first~DnDCity|We spent 5 days getting to the Port of Triton, and another 8 sailing, so that means we have 2 days left.  Better hurry to the castle!~DnDCastle|No, it was 7 days to the Port of Triton, and then 10 for sailing, which means we have…-2 days?  That can’t be right.~DnDMathFail
