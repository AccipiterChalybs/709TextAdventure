You sneak past the goblins with such ease, you actually were able to fart a few times without them noticing.  They begin arguing with each other over who smelt it and who delt it until a huge riot breaks out.  Goblins begin killing goblins, and soon there are only two left.  The brief break in battle brings them to their senses.  Realizing what they have done, they drop their weapons and come in for a hug and a cry.  Seizing the opportunity, you stab both of them simultaneously.  Congratulations, you just killed the entire Mildly Irritated Goblin Tribe.  Way to goâ€¦|Claim your reward~DnDKingReau
