You have no idea what you’re doing.  You light a match below decks and accidentally light a comically long fuse leading to the powder kegs.  Despite your best efforts to blow it out, stomp it out, or cut the fuse, it continues towards the kegs.  At the last minute, you leap off the ship into the water.  The explosion kills the sea serpent, and your ship.  You cling to a piece of the aft dinghy (you think that’s what it is) and ride out the storm.|Several Days Later…~DnDLand
