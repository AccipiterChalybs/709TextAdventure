Before we begin, which adventurer will you choose?\'94|Sir Ambrosious Goldenloin, the righteously good-looking half-angel paladin~DnDAmbrosious1|Shonmander, the laserbeam-weilding human wizard, and Pabu, his friendly fire ferret~DnDShonmander1|Reau, the bag-hiding, sneak-attacking halfling rogue~DnDReau1|Vinculum, the elf ranger who once headshotted a lich mid-monologue~DnDVinculum1}
