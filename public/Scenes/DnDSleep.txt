While the goblins are asleep, you walk right into the castle and speak with the Durger King.
“Shonmander!  Thank you for your assistance with the goblins!  Unfortunately, I need them out of my kingdom forever, so just making them fall asleep at my front door doesn’t help much.  Hoewever, I know that these particular goblins have one weakness: pranks.  If you can pull a wicked awesome prank on them while they sleep, they will recognize you as the prankmaster, and they must do as you say!  How will you prank them?”|Conjure warm water buckets and place each goblin’s hand inside one~DnDBedWet|Conjure whipped cream on the palm of every goblin’s hand, and cast a Level 1 Mass Tickle spell on their noses~DnDFacePalm
