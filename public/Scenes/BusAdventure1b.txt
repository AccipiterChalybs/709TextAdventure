Hoping that you can catch up to the bus or find a bus that doesn't go to the previous bus stop, you head to the next one. Unfortunately, there are no buses here either. You then head to the next one, but still no buses. You wander around a bit unsure of what to do, then realize you are lost. You are on a path above a large road, with several cars going by.|Cross a bridge over the main road.~RockBottom
